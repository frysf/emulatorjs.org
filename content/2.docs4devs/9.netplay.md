# Netplay

The old version of netplay that works versions prior to 4.0 (version 3.0) is really buggy and not recommended unless you need to.

  - Netplay is currently **not supported**. Any bugs will not be fixed. A netplay re-write is being worked on.

## To add to your site

1. Set a game id in the javascript config
```js
EJS_gameID = 1; //Id needs to be unique per game in your website!
```

2. At the moment, netplay requires the old cores. To do this you must add this line to your code.
```js
EJS_oldCores = true;
```

**These 2 steps will add netplay to your website!**

## To host your own server:

1. Clone the EmulatorJS-netplay repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS-netplay-old.git
```

2. Install nodejs dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

3. start the server
```sh
npm run start
```

You can then set your netplay server with the `EJS_netplayUrl` setting.
```js
EJS_netplayUrl = "URL HERE";
```
<!-- EJS_netplayServer -->
