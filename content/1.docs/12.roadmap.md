# Roadmap

* [Netplay](/docs4devs/netplay) (multiplayer over the web) - We are currently working on this feature. 

Our Github milestones page can be found [here](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/milestones).

Note: These are goals are not in any specific order, nor do they have estimated dates to completion. The only thing that is for certain is that they will be completed sooner as more people contribute to this and [libretro's](https://retroarch.com/index.php?page=donate) projects.
